# myHealthCare 
## Project Overview
### :exclamation: Background :exclamation:
myHealthCare is a mock-up dashboard created for Mia Lustria's Introduction to Health Informatics at Florida State. This project provided multiple opportunities; not only were we given the freedom to tap into our inner creative fire, this project reinforced key terms and definitions learned throughout the course. As a group of 4, we were tasked with creating a healthcare solution. We believed that a dashboard would prove itself most useful solution for everyday people.

We sat down and asked ourselves what we wished we could have easy access to. As a group, we yearned for an application that would:
* Find credible physicians easier
* Keep track of our prescriptions
* Ease the appointment making process
* Track our health and inform our physicians
* **Host our Electronic Health Records**
* Manage specific payments

Keeping these items in mind, we believed that an all-encompassing dashboard would benefit the most users. 

### :book: Research :book:

Key Terms | Significance 
--------- | ---------
Electronic Health Record (EHR) | A complete record of the user's medical history. Not to be confused with an Electronic Medical Record, an EHR keeps track of a patients history from **all** physicians. 
Interoperability | This allows different computer systems to connect and interact with one another. In the healthcare environment, it would mean the passing of patient information from one platform to another. This can prove difficult as there are many methods of storing patient information. A lack in cohesion is the enemy of interoperability.
